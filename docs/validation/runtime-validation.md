# Runtime validation

Date: 2026-09-25  
Branch: `main`

This document separates automated evidence from checks that require a real Cities: Skylines II session. Unit tests, CI and static inspection do **not** convert an in-game scenario into a pass. If a scenario was not actually executed, its status remains **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED**.

| Adaptive-overhead hysteresis GREEN | commit `b7386dd9dbefd74d948ce0b15ffddf5c799646bd`, Actions run `36019152958` | PASS | Degradation requires three consecutive over-ceiling observations during an active capture and resets for a new capture. |

Source-level regression checks lock the closed-panel HUD-only refresh and immediate full refresh on panel open. |
| Managed-reference API inspection | supplied `CS2-managed-reference-fix(1).zip` | PASS for referenced type presence | `Colossal.UI.Binding.dll` contains `RawValueBinding` and `IJsonWriter`; the hardening change introduces no new game-facing API family beyond APIs already used by the mod.

This validates the README against the supplied toolchain files, not against an actual Windows build. |
| UI dependency audit notice | UI CI install output | OPEN | `npm install` currently reports 5 dependency vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 1 high, 1 critical). No forced dependency upgrade was applied without advisory/package-level evidence; this remains a separate dependency-maintenance item. |

## In-game validation matrix

Record concrete measurements and evidence in this table when the scenarios are executed. Do not replace missing measurements with inferred values.

| # | Scenario | Status | Selected speed | Actual speed | FPS | Profiler overhead | Capture coverage | Errors / warnings | Pass criteria / notes |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Profiler disabled baseline | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Set `EnableMonitoring` false, allow at least one system update for the disable transition, and independently confirm recorder activity stops before collecting the baseline. |
| 2 | Stable Normal Monitoring on a new/vanilla city | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Global/domain metrics remain stable and truthful; no unexplained errors; measure profiler overhead rather than assuming it. |
| 3 | Normal Monitoring on the representative ~40k modded city | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Same-save comparison against disabled baseline; observe stability and overhead under the intended real workload. |
| 4 | Manual Deep Capture | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Manual request starts a bounded capture, records the intended Deep window and post-buffer, attempts safe marker categories, reports coverage/batching, and does not force Job completion or mutate gameplay state. |
| 5 | Automatic Deep Capture during selected 4x / reduced actual speed | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Verify the trigger from observed data: efficiency below 0.80 continuously for at least 2 s. Confirm pre/deep/post context without treating correlation as a proven cause. |
| 6 | Large marker set / batched coverage | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Confirm batching remains bounded (configured concurrent recorder ceiling: 150), adaptive reduction occurs only after sustained profiler overhead, every safe category is attempted across batches as designed, and Diagnostics coverage matches what was actually sampled. |
| 7 | Collector failure / deliberately unavailable member | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Failure remains isolated; monitoring continues; warning/diagnostic is visible; unavailable data is not rendered as zero or fabricated. |
| 8 | Mod-owned ECS system classification | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | A uniquely matched direct system marker produces timing for the correct full type; direct owner assembly/mod metadata is retained and Mods totals use direct ownership only. |
| 9 | Patched vanilla system metadata | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Vanilla system remains the timing owner; patch owner(s) appear as metadata and do not inherit the vanilla timing as direct mod cost. |
| 10 | JSON export and privacy inspection | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Selected-capture values in JSON match the UI/source capture. Inspect for `C:\Users\`, account name, absolute `ModsData`/home paths and other identifying path leakage before sharing. |
| 11 | Monitoring OFF during an active Deep Capture | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | Verify active recorders stop on the disable transition, no capture sampling continues while disabled, and re-enabling returns to a coherent normal/deep lifecycle without errors. |
| 12 | Profiler panel closed for an extended session | **NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED** | — | — | — | — | — | — | HUD speed/capture state continues updating while the full Systems/Mods/Timeline/Captures snapshot is not periodically rebuilt; opening the panel immediately refreshes full detail. |

## Measurement protocol

1. Use the same save, camera position and simulation state where practical.
2. For the disabled baseline, set `EnableMonitoring` false and allow the monitoring lifecycle transition to execute. The current implementation deactivates the shared recorder manager on that transition and restores the normal recorder set once when monitoring is enabled again. Independently verify recorder inactivity in-game before treating the run as a zero-sampling baseline.
3. Record selected speed, actual speed, FPS, profiler self-overhead, capture coverage, errors and warnings.
4. Exercise both manual and automatic capture paths.
5. For the representative slowdown case, preserve the pre/deep/post timeline and describe only observed correlations unless an independent causal test supports a stronger statement.
6. Inspect the exported JSON itself; UI appearance alone is not sufficient for privacy/export validation.
7. For long-session memory validation, create more than 20 captures and confirm the UI retains only the newest 20 completed sessions while timing projection continues for newly completed captures.
8. With the panel closed, compare profiler self-overhead against the panel-open state; the closed state should perform only the lightweight HUD binding update at the periodic UI refresh cadence.

The design targets for Normal Monitoring are **<1% CPU overhead** and **<2% simulation-impact overhead**. These are acceptance targets only. They must not be reported as achieved until measured in-game with an appropriate baseline.

## System timing acceptance checks

For a completed capture that contains a uniquely matching ECS profiler marker:

- `TimeNanoseconds` is converted to milliseconds.
- Current, mean, median, P95, P99, max, total and calls are preserved where samples exist.
- Full type name matching is conservative; ambiguous matches are skipped rather than guessed.
- The completed `CaptureSession.SystemTiming` is populated exactly once while it remains in retained history and remains available to Systems/Mods UI projection.
- Completed capture history is bounded; eviction of older sessions must not cause new sessions to be skipped by timing finalization.
- Direct mod ownership and patch-owner metadata remain separate concepts.
- Missing or unsafe-to-measure work remains unavailable/unattributed; no forced Job completion is introduced.

The pure-layer tests cover projection/finalization, skipped-state lifecycle behavior, monitoring edge tracking, overhead adaptation and bounded-history behavior. UI CI covers the compact HUD binding and closed-panel refresh policy. Actual Unity/CS2 profiler marker names, game lifecycle behavior, full Windows mod compilation and UI presentation with real captures still require the in-game matrix above.

## Release-candidate evidence policy

For each runtime row, attach or reference enough evidence to reproduce the result: save/scenario description, game/mod version, logs, screenshots or capture/export artifacts, and the measured values. If evidence is incomplete, leave the row **UNVERIFIED** rather than inferring a pass.
